#Bird-Detection-Peacetopia
This project is about developing a Bird Detection system approach for the city of Peacetopia with the help of a machine learning approach.

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning algorithm for detecting birds in the fictional city of Peacetopia. The city faces a unique challenge, with citizens fearful of birds. Our goal is to create an accurate and efficient bird detection system.

## Problem Statement
Peacetopiaâ€™s security cameras capture 10 million images of the sky. Our task is to classify each image as either containing a bird or not, while providing highest accuracy and adhering to strict memory and runtime constraints.

## Solution
We evaluated various models based on:
- **Accuracy**: Aiming for the highest possible accuracy in detecting birds.
- **Efficiency**: Ensuring the model runs quickly and can fit within limited memory.

- ## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bird-detection-peacetopia.git
