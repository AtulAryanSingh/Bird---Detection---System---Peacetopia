# Bird Detection System - Peacetopia

## Overview
The Bird Detection System project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm for detecting birds in the fictional city of Peacetopia. The city faces a unique challenge, with citizens being fearful of birds. Our goal is to create an accurate and efficient bird detection system that can process images from security cameras and classify them as containing a bird or not.

## Problem Statement
Peacetopia’s security cameras capture millions of images of the sky. Our task is to classify each image as either containing a bird or not, while ensuring the highest accuracy and adhering to strict memory and runtime constraints.

## Solution
We evaluate various models based on:
- **Accuracy:** Aiming for the highest possible accuracy in detecting birds.
- **Efficiency:** Ensuring the model runs quickly and can fit within limited memory.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on the model used)
- `opencv-python` (for image processing)
- Any other necessary libraries as per your model requirements.

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow opencv-python

#Bird-Detection-Peacetopia
This project is about developing a Bird Detection system approach for the city of Peacetopia with the help of a machine learning approach.

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning algorithm for detecting birds in the fictional city of Peacetopia. The city faces a unique challenge, with citizens fearful of birds. Our goal is to create an accurate and efficient bird detection system.

## Problem Statement
Peacetopia’s security cameras capture 10 million images of the sky. Our task is to classify each image as either containing a bird or not, while providing highest accuracy and adhering to strict memory and runtime constraints.

## Solution
We evaluated various models based on:
- **Accuracy**: Aiming for the highest possible accuracy in detecting birds.
- **Efficiency**: Ensuring the model runs quickly and can fit within limited memory.
